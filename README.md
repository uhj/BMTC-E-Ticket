# BMTC-E-Ticket
# Introduction

#	Bus stops/bays in Bangalore are probably the most active places with 4.6 million people engaged and interacting with public transportation of the city on daily basis. To prevent revenue leakage, we are building a Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) electronic ticketing (e-ticketing) system.

# i. Existing System: Currently system is present for online booking of tickets for post planned travelling of passengers. For e.g. irctc, redbus, cleartrip, makemytrip etc... which provides the availability of seats in train or bus based on the requirements of passengers and online portal to transact money via: - online banking, debit card, credit card.

# ii. Proposed System: We are planning to build a system where passengers can buy tickets at real time (on the spot for short distance) and get the details of the ticket to their registered mobile numbers and travel. Initially consumers should register through our website. On registration, BMTC card (like metro card) will be provided to them. Based on the amount credited by the consumer in the card he/she can swipe the card on which he/she gets an auto generated message to the registered mobile number providing details like ticket number, from and to place, ticket price, time etc...
